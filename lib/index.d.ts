/**
  An [aws-cdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) construct that uses [ClamAV®](https://www.clamav.net/).
  to scan objects in Amazon S3 for viruses. The construct provides a flexible interface for a system
  to act based on the results of a ClamAV virus scan.

  The construct creates a Lambda function with EFS integration to support larger files.
  A VPC with isolated subnets, a S3 Gateway endpoint will also be created.

  Additionally creates an twice-daily job to download the latest ClamAV definition files to the
  Virus Definitions S3 Bucket by utilizing an EventBridge rule and a Lambda function and
  publishes CloudWatch Metrics to the 'serverless-clamscan' namespace.

  __Important O&M__:
  When ClamAV publishes updates to the scanner you will see “Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED” in your scan results.
  While the construct creates a system to keep the database definitions up to date, you must update the scanner to
  detect all the latest Viruses.

  Update the docker images of the Lambda functions with the latest version of ClamAV by re-running `cdk deploy`.

  Successful Scan Event format
  ```json
  {
     "source": "serverless-clamscan",
     "input_bucket": <input_bucket_name>,
     "input_key": <object_key>,
     "status": <"CLEAN"|"INFECTED"|"N/A">,
     "message": <scan_summary>,
   }
  ```

  Note: The Virus Definitions bucket policy will likely cause a deletion error if you choose to delete
  the stack associated in the construct. However since the bucket itself gets deleted, you can delete
  the stack again to resolve the error.
